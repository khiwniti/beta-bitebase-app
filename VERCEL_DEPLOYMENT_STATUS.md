# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Status - BiteBase Intelligence

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

**Great news!** Your BiteBase Intelligence application is successfully deploying on Vercel!

### Current Status: npm install running ✅
The deployment process is working correctly. The warnings you see are normal deprecation warnings that won't affect functionality.

## 📋 Deprecation Warnings Explained

### These warnings are SAFE to ignore for now:
- `rimraf@3.0.2` - Build tool, doesn't affect runtime
- `inflight@1.0.6` - Internal dependency, will be updated automatically
- `glob@7.1.7` - File pattern matching, works fine
- `text-encoding@0.6.4` - Polyfill, not needed in modern browsers
- `@humanwhocodes/*` - ESLint dependencies, non-critical

### Why these warnings appear:
- They're from nested dependencies (dependencies of dependencies)
- Not directly controlled by your package.json
- Common in large Node.js projects
- Don't affect application functionality
